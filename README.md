Now project is not working because of my experiments on the server with JWT.
Server (back-end) is published by heroku on address https://dobr-task-manager.herokuapp.com *

To make requests need to send it to */api/v1/tasks

But now it doesn't work because of JWT

P. S. But in the repo named "TaskManager" is previous version, so it must work but it is not published.
